docker-apache2
==============

This container was written for use within Docker (https://www.docker.com/) 

This Docker container uses a minimal Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) Operating System and installs apache2. 

The default port that is portmapped to the host is 80. - This could be modified to run using any port that you specify.

Feel free to contribute to the project, and if you have any suggestions feel free to email me or post them.
